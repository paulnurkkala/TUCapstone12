It can also be useful for reducing the amount of time to create certain effects.

1655,AK,X,10,"What is meant by ""functional language""? Example.",COS382,In computer science&#44; functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions&#44; in contrast to the imperative programming style&#44; which emphasizes changes in state.[1] Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus&#44; a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate function definition&#44; function application&#44; and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus.[1] Javascript is an example of a functional language. prominent functional programming languages such as Common Lisp&#44; Scheme&#44;[2][3][4][5] ISLISP&#44; JavaScript&#44; Clojure&#44; Racket&#44;[6] Erlang&#44;[7][8][9] OCaml&#44;[10][11] Haskell&#44;[12][13] Scala[14] and F#[15][16]

1718,AK,X,9.33,Give an overview of the process of communicating securely using a public-key cryptosystem (e.g.&#44; RSA).,MAT215,RSA is an algorithm for public-key cryptography that is based on the presumed difficulty of factoring large integers&#44; the factoring problem. RSA stands for Ron Rivest&#44; Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman&#44; who first publicly described it in 1977. Clifford Cocks&#44; an English mathematician&#44; had developed an equivalent system in 1973&#44; but it was classified until 1997. A user of RSA creates and then publishes the product of two large prime numbers&#44; along with an auxiliary value&#44; as their public key. The prime factors must be kept secret. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message&#44; but with currently published methods&#44; if the public key is large enough&#44; only someone with knowledge of the prime factors can feasibly decode the message. Whether breaking RSA encryption is as hard as factoring is an open question known as the RSA problem.

1142,AK,X,7.07,Why is RSA encryption secure? Cite two distinct major points.,MAT215,RSA is an algorithm for public-key cryptography that is based on the presumed difficulty of factoring large integers&#44; the factoring problem. RSA stands for Ron Rivest&#44; Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman&#44; who first publicly described it in 1977. Clifford Cocks&#44; an English mathematician&#44; had developed an equivalent system in 1973&#44; but it was classified until 1997. A user of RSA creates and then publishes the product of two large prime numbers&#44; along with an auxiliary value&#44; as their public key. The prime factors must be kept secret. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message&#44; but with currently published methods&#44; if the public key is large enough&#44; only someone with knowledge of the prime factors can feasibly decode the message. Whether breaking RSA encryption is as hard as factoring is an open question known as the RSA problem.
1175,SRW,X,7,How do you develop recursive algorithms?,COS121,Write a function that calls itself. More specifically&#44; you want to have a base case and a recursive case.

1635,SRW,X,7,How do neural networks function? What types of problems are the good for solving?,SYS411,"Basic unit is a perceptron. Takes input and applies a function to it to determine if it will ""fire"" or not (produces output). Many of these can be linked together to form a network.

It emphasizes the application of functions&#44; in contrast to the imperative programming style&#44; which emphasizes changes in state.[1] Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus&#44; a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate function definition&#44; function application&#44; and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus.[1] Javascript is an example of a functional language. prominent functional programming languages such as Common Lisp&#44; Scheme&#44;[2][3][4][5] ISLISP&#44; JavaScript&#44; Clojure&#44; Racket&#44;[6] Erlang&#44;[7][8][9] OCaml&#44;[10][11] Haskell&#44;[12][13] Scala[14] and F#[15][16]

RSA stands for Ron Rivest&#44; Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman&#44; who first publicly described it in 1977. Clifford Cocks&#44; an English mathematician&#44; had developed an equivalent system in 1973&#44; but it was classified until 1997. A user of RSA creates and then publishes the product of two large prime numbers&#44; along with an auxiliary value&#44; as their public key. The prime factors must be kept secret. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message&#44; but with currently published methods&#44; if the public key is large enough&#44; only someone with knowledge of the prime factors can feasibly decode the message. Whether breaking RSA encryption is as hard as factoring is an open question known as the RSA problem.
