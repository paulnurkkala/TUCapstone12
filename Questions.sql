A user of RSA creates and then publishes the product of two large prime numbers&#44; along with an auxiliary value&#44; as their public key. The prime factors must be kept secret. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message&#44; but with currently published methods&#44; if the public key is large enough&#44; only someone with knowledge of the prime factors can feasibly decode the message.
